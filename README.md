# Proto-Pineal

Proto-Pineal is an experimental research architecture developed by **Cognis 11 Inc**.
It explores synthetic cognition through geometry-anchored memory, symbolic substrates,
and long-horizon coherence constraints.

This repository contains:
- Core architectural experiments
- Symbolic memory systems (ATL8)
- Cognitive geometry artifacts
- Instrumentation for coherence, drift, and identity preservation

Proto-Pineal is not a model.
It is an instrument.

## Status
Active research. Rapid iteration. Interfaces may change without notice.

## Philosophy
Scale is not intelligence.
Continuity, structure, and memory are.

## Structure
- `src/proto_pineal/` Core runtime and interfaces
- `atl8/` Symbolic memory substrate (implementation + specs)
- `seeds/` Versioned research artefacts (design lineage)
- `experiments/` Reproducible tests, probes, benchmarks
- `visual/` Geometry viewers and renderers
- `docs/` Notes, specs, references
